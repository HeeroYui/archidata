Migration tool
==============

Migration is a big part of the Server environment, it permit to migrate an old DB to a new one, and some tool permit the opposite.

Archi-data does not permit to do a reverse migration. I implement some code for it, but is was never tested. On my professional activity, we migrate only forward (Request if if really needed).
